<h1> Logging and Metrics</h1>
  <h2>Logging</h2>
    <p>
      Monitoring error logs is important because it helps us identify errors and problems in the system.
      You can monitor logs at server level or aggregate them and monitor logs of all servers together at a centralized logging server, thus allowing us to view logs of all servers easily.

  <h2>Metrics</h2>
    <p>
      Collecting different types of metrics helps us to understand overall health of the system.
      Following metrics can be useful:
      <ul>
        <li>Server or host metrics like CPU usage, memory, disk I/O etc</li>
        <li>Performance of entire database tier or cluster of hosts.</li>
        <li>Daily active users, revenue, retention of users etc.</li>
      </ul>
