<h1>Horizontal Scaling</h1>
  <p>Horizontal scaling means scaling by adding more machines to your pool of resources.</p>
  <p>One of the fundamental differences between the two is that horizontal scaling requires breaking a sequential piece of logic into smaller pieces so that they can be executed in parallel across multiple machines. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>We horizontal scale by adding several small servers/machines.</li>
    <li>We need a load balancer to balance the load amongst all other machines.</li>
    <li>If one of the machine fails, you can redirect the request to the several other machines</li>
    <li>What ever communication we have between the machines, it is over the network, and networks are usually slow as comapred to inter-process communication</li>
    <li>Data can be inconsistent, because there are several machines, it may take some time for machines to copy data from other machines</li>
    <li>Scales well, we can add as many servers/machines as we like</li>
  </ul>

<h1>Vertical Scaling</h1>
  <p>Vertical scaling means, scaling by adding more power (e.g. CPU, RAM) to an existing machine.</p>
  <p>Vertical scaling is easier because the logic really doesn't need to change. Rather, youâ€™re just running the same code on higher-spec machines.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>We vertical scale by adding more power to our existing server</li>
    <li>We can increase power of our existing machine by adding more processing power, giving it more storage, etc</li>
    <li>We dont require a load balancer since there is just one big system</li>
    <li>But if this one big system fails then the entire service goes down</li>
    <li>If we want to communicate between 2 independent systems, then we have inter process communication thats faster.</li>
    <li>The data just resides on one system, so data will always be consistent</li>
    <li>There will eventually be some hardware limitaitons, so it eventually won't scale</li>
  </ul>
