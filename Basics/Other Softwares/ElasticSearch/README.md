<h1>Elastic Search</h1>
  <p>
    It is a distributed search and analysis engine built on Apache Lucene. <br/>
    It is commonly used for log analytics. <br/>
    Elasticsearch allows you to store, search, and analyze huge volumes of data quickly. 
    It’s able to achieve fast search responses because instead of searching the text directly, it searches an index.
  </p>
  <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <p>
      You can send the data in form of a JSON document and Elasticsearch automatically stores the original document and adds a searchable reference to the document in the cluster’s index.
