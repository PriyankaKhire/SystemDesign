<h1>Zookeeper</h1>
  <p>Apache Zookeeper is an open source distributed <b>coordination service</b> that helps to manage a large set of servers. <br/>
    It helps you with maintaining configuration information , naming , providing distributed synchronization, and providing group services. <br/>
    So, essentially it's just a piece of software that runs on all your servers and manages them.
  </p>
  <h2>Architecture</h2>
    <p> Zookeeper follows a Master-Slave architecture. If the master fails, then one the slaves is elected as the new master.
      All the servers must know about each other. <br/><br/>
      Clients can connect to a single zookeeper server. however, when a client is started they are provided a list of servers, so when a connection to the connected server fails then the client can connect to any other server in the cluster.

  <h2>Advantages</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Simple distributed coordination process</li>
      <li>Reliability</li>
      <li>Serialization âˆ’ Encode the data according to specific rules. Ensure your application runs consistently. This approach can be used in MapReduce to coordinate queue to execute running threads.</li>
