<h1>Network Protocols</h1>
  <p>Network protocols make it possible for any networked computers to talk to each other</p>
  <h2>Networking Models</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>TCP/IP Model</li>
      <li>OSI Model</li>
    </ol>
  <h2>Networking Protocols</h2>
  <p>Some of the common networking protocols are listed below.</p>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Internet Protocol (IP):</b> It is the key protocol that allows computers in different physical networks to communicate with each other</li>
      <li><b>Transport Control Protocol (TCP):</b> It works by first establishing a connection between the client and server, and then transferring data. It builds on IP to add guarantees that data messages are delivered reliably and, in order</li>
      <li><b>User Datagram Protocol (UDP):</b> It works at the same layer as TCP, but has no guarantees about data delivery or ordering. So if the application needs faster data transfer and doesnâ€™t require a confirmed connection we can use UDP</li>
      <li><b>Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP):</b> It allows applications to view and modify data over the network </li>
	  <li><b>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP>:</b> It's used for sending email messages between email servers</li>
	  <li><b>Post Office Protocol (POP) and Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP):</b> POP and IMAP are protocols used by email clients to retrieve emails from a mail server. IMAP allows users to manage emails on the server, while POP typically downloads emails to the client's device.</li>
	  <li><b>Domain Name System (DNS):</b> DNS translates domain names (e.g., www.example.com) into IP addresses. It's crucial for locating resources on the internet.</li>
	  <li><b>Secure Shell (SSH):</b> SSH provides secure remote access to devices over a network, allowing users to log in to a remote system securely and execute commands.</li>
