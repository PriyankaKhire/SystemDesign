<h1>Cassandra</h1>
  <p>It is a NoSQL database. <br/>
  It was originally created at Facebook.
  </p>
  <h2>Architecture</h2>
    <p>The basic architecture consists of a cluster of nodes, any and all of which can accept a read or write request. This is a key aspect of its architecture, as there are no master nodes. Instead, all nodes communicate equally.</p>
  <h2>Advantages</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>It is AP system, offering high availability and partition tolerance (i.e no single point of failure)</li>
    <li>NoSQL databases do not require fixed schema, allowing for easy replication.</li>
    <li>Can handle high volumes of data across multiple servers.</li>
    <li>It is able to fast write huge amounts of data without affecting the read efficiency.</li>
    <li>Is Horizontally scalable.</li>
    <li>Supports ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability) property.</li>
  </ol>
