<h1>Domain Name System (DNS)</h1>
  <p>You can think of DNS as the Phone book of the internet. 
    Each device (or server) connected to the internet has a unique IP address, this IP address is used by other devices to find that device (or server).<br/>
    A DNS service translates human readable names like www.example.com into the numeric IP addresses that computers use to connect to each other.
