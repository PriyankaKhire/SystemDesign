<h1>Quorum</h1>
  <p>In Distributed Systems, data is replicated across multiple servers for fault
    tolerance and high availability. Once a system decides to maintain multiple
    copies of data, another problem arises: how to make sure that all replicas are
    consistent, i.e., if they all have the latest copy of the data and that all clients
    see the same view of the data?</p>
  <p>Quorum is the minimum number of nodes where the distributed operation (such as replicating data) needs to be done successfully.</p>
  <h2>What value should we choose for a quorum?</h2>
    <p>If the cluster has <code>N</code> nodes then <code>(N/2)+1</code> i.e. more than half the nodes in the cluster.</p>
  <h2>Home Nodes</h2>
    <p>Now that we have our quorum number, we can't just start writing to nodes and count how many nodes we have written to and have we reached that quorum number or not. <br/>
      We hand pick nodes (number of nodes match the quorum number) and call them our home nodes.
    </p>
  <h2>Sloppy Quorum</h2>
    <p>Now what if some of these <code>Home Nodes</code> are down due to a network interruption?</p>
    <p>We then perform successful reads and writes on first <code>N</code> healthy nodes.</p>
    <p>Think about it this way, if you lose the keys to your house, you can go and stay at your neighbor's house for the night or until you find your keys.</p>
<h1>Hinted handoff</h1>
  <p>Once the network interruption is fixed, any data that was written to these <code>Non-home nodes</code> is then sent to the Home nodes.</p>
  <p>So when you find your house keys, your neighbor then asks you to leave.</p>
